# mingle-api

A Clojure library designed to demonstrate basic Mingle API usage (with HMAC auth)

One day this might grow into a real API, at the moment it's just useful as sample code.

## Usage

set the following environment variables:

export MINGLE_KEY=/XfZiNotArealKeyUDoofusTLA/cXYZZYmCU=

export MINGLE_USER=myname

export MINGLE_HOST=myhost.mingle-api.thoughtworks.com

Then 'lein run project_short_name' to dump the wiki stats for a mingle project
